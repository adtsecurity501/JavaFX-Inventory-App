## Getting Started

Set up and run the application locally with these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 21 or higher
- Apache Maven installed and configured in your PATH
- Access to the network location hosting the SQLite database

### Configuration

Update the hardcoded database connection path:

- **File**: `src/main/java/assettracking/db/DatabaseConnection.java`
- **Variable**: `DATABASE_PATHS_OR_UNCS`
- Set to your `inventorybackup.db` file location.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adtsecurity501/JavaFX-Inventory-App.git
   cd JavaFX-Inventory-App
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

### Building the Executable JAR

Create a standalone JAR with all dependencies:

1. Run the package command:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   ```

2. Locate the JAR (e.g., `ATLegMav-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) in the `target/` directory. Run it on any machine with Java 21.

## Core Workflows

### Processing a New Device

1. **Package Intake**: In the "Package Intake" tab, scan the tracking number, complete details, and click "Start Package Intake."
2. **Add Assets**: In the "Package Details" window, select "Receive Asset(s)," enter serial number and details, then save.
3. **Update Status**: In the "Device Status Tracking" tab, locate the device and update its status (e.g., WIP to Processed).
4. **Print Labels**:
    - **During Update**: Set status to "Ready for Deployment" to prompt SKU and Serial label printing.
    - **On-Demand**: Use the "Label Printing" tab, select "Bulk Deploy," enter SKU, scan serial, and print.
