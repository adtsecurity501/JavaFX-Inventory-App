## Overview

Designed for **IT depots** and **refurbishment centers**, this application centralizes asset management with a
user-friendly interface and robust, cross-platform functionality. It is built to handle both the routine tracking of
individual assets and the complex logistics of provisioning large batches of devices for new hires or deployments.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Monitor key metrics like weekly intake, inventory status, and processing goals at a glance.
- **AD & SCCM Machine Removal**: A dedicated tab to find and delete computer objects from Active Directory and SCCM,
  powered by PowerShell automation in the background.
- **iPad Bulk Provisioning**:
    - Import and persistently store master device lists from Excel.
    - Update existing device records (e.g., SIM card changes) automatically on re-import.
    - Streamlined UI for rapidly matching devices to employees from a roster file.
    - Manual override for on-the-fly SIM card updates.
    - Export finalized assignments to a pre-formatted Excel template for service providers.
- **Package Intake**: Simplified package receiving with automatic ZIP code lookup and duplicate tracking prevention.
- **Device Status Tracking**: Searchable, filterable asset view with status tracking and a secure **permanent deletion**
  option for erroneous entries.
- **Unified Flag Management**: A dedicated interface to view, add, edit, and permanently remove flagged devices.
  Includes a bulk-import feature from Excel files.
- **Box ID Management**: Group disposed assets into virtual boxes, print box labels, and export contents.
- **ZPL Label Printing**:
    - **Core Tools**: Supports bulk tasks like SKU + Serial label printing and bulk image labels.
    - **Utility Printing**: On-demand single asset tags or generic barcodes.
- **Robust Data Operations**:
    - Export comprehensive inventory reports to **XLSX (with summary dashboards and pivot tables)** or CSV, reflecting
      only the latest status of each device.
    - Bulk-import device autofill data from spreadsheets.
    - Import and overwrite Master Equipment List (MEL) rules from Excel.

## Deployment & Running

This application uses a client-server model where the user's machine runs the client application, and the database
resides on a central network share.

### Database Setup

The application connects to a central H2 database file located on a network share. It uses H2's `AUTO_SERVER=TRUE`
feature, which means the first user to connect automatically starts a temporary server process, allowing other users to
connect simultaneously.

- **Location**: The database files (`inventorybackup.mv.db`) must be accessible on a network path.
- **Configuration**: The path is set in the `config.properties` file.

```properties
# config.properties
# The URL points to a file on a network share.
# AUTO_SERVER=TRUE allows multiple users to connect.
db.url=jdbc:h2:file:////UTSPRJ2C2333/Server/inventorybackup;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE
db.user=sa
db.password=
```

- **`H2 Server` Folder**: This folder, containing `Start_H2_Server.bat`, is **not required** for the standard setup to
  work. It is an alternative for administrators to run the database in a dedicated TCP server mode.

---

### Client Setup (for End Users)

To run the application, a user needs a folder containing the following four items. This folder can be located on a
shared drive like OneDrive:

1. **`ATLegMav-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`** â€“ Main application file
2. **`jre`** â€“ Bundled Java Runtime Environment (no need to install Java)
3. **`config.properties`** â€“ Points to the central database
4. **`Run Inventory App.bat`** â€“ Script that launches the app

The `Run Inventory App.bat` script:

- Copies the app files to the userâ€™s local `Temp` folder
- Uses the bundled JRE to guarantee correct Java version
- Launches the application silently in the background

```batch
@echo off
:: This script copies the application locally and launches it silently.

:: 1. Define Paths
SET "SCRIPT_DIR=%~dp0"
SET "ONEDRIVE_JAR=%SCRIPT_DIR%ATLegMav-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
SET "ONEDRIVE_CONFIG=%SCRIPT_DIR%config.properties"
SET "LOCAL_JAR=%TEMP%\ATLegMav-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
SET "LOCAL_CONFIG=%TEMP%\config.properties"
SET "BUNDLED_JAVA=%SCRIPT_DIR%jre\bin\java.exe"

:: 2. Copy files to the local temp folder.
COPY /Y "%ONEDRIVE_JAR%" "%LOCAL_JAR%" > NUL
COPY /Y "%ONEDRIVE_CONFIG%" "%LOCAL_CONFIG%" > NUL

:: 3. Launch the application silently using PowerShell.
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "& '%BUNDLED_JAVA%' --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -jar '%LOCAL_JAR%'"
```

## For Developers

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adtsecurity501/JavaFX-Inventory-App.git
cd JavaFX-Inventory-App
```

Ensure you have access to the network share where the H2 database file is located.

### Run with Maven

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

---

### AI Assistance Workflow

Run this in **PowerShell** at the project root to generate a single file with all source code:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path all_code.txt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
tree /F /A > all_code.txt
Add-Content -Path all_code.txt -Value "`n--- CODE ---`n"
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include "*.java", "*.fxml", "*.xml", "*.css" | Where-Object { $_.FullName -notlike '*\jre\*' } | ForEach-Object {
    $relativePath = $_.FullName.Substring($PWD.Path.Length)
    Add-Content -Path all_code.txt -Value "`n>> .$relativePath`n"
    Get-Content $_.FullName | Out-File -Append -FilePath all_code.txt
}
```

This creates an `all_code.txt` file you can paste into Google AI Studio for code assistance.

## Building the Executable JAR

Create a standalone JAR with all dependencies:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Locate the JAR (e.g., `ATLegMav-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) in the `target/` directory.
