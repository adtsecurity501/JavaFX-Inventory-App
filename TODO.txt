Priority 1:
- add way to import information into the device_autofill_data table.
- when an error appears or a window apperas sometimes it dissapears minimized super small to the left bottom corner 



Priority 2:
- fix visual bug on label printing tab, when you click generic barcode the whole row increases in size
- test printing labels from scan update.
- Test all features extensively
- Make sure history works
- clean the monitor data, look for long dell serials that are incorrect. 
- Dig into WIP backlog, what is that?
- update statuses and substatuses across whole app so it's consistent
- update categories and statuses in database
- inlclude monitors in the WIP backlog on dashboard

At End:
- rename the database and change paths everwhere
- clean up code and extra files and tables
- add comments and describe the code so that a dev can work on it and update, maybe make a manual for it.
- create executable for program 
- Update the readme


DONE:
- Same row height for all in the package management tab
- double check view for same serial multiple times
- double check that the import flags doens't afecct the dispostion of devices that are actually good to go.
- Logic for If flag date is from before, and we then process and intake a device, then set the status to ready for deployment.
- Clean up all Categorys
- Update serial intake to ignore SERIAL NUMBER	IMEI/MEID	ICCID	Capacity	Name rows
- Change the flow of UI for ipad bulk
- Add receive date to view history and remove receipt ID column from the Devcice history window.
- add a way to search throught the ipads in the db in the ipad provisioning, maybe some filters?
- add button to update the serial for selected row of ipad on staged devices for export
- Add search and filters to sku management
- integrate items.xlsx into the sku table
- add flow to accomodate for monitor intake
	-what I do is first input/Scan serial
	-then I add description of what it is using autofill hopefully if it's there, if not I manually add info
	- I then test the monitor to see if it's functinoing and not broken, then I want to have option for ready to 		deploy so that it sets the correcct status and print the labels for it using the sku table and 		description I put in.
	- if not functinoing then dispositoin option as disposal canam
- update SKU_table_import script so that it properly attaches sku to description based on options
- Integrate the label printing code
	-checkbox print toggle on scan update so I dont have to have user interaction
	-add autocomplete
	-move bulk section together maybe rething the layout and grouping
- update the scan update logic for disposal, if we want to dispose of something you have to have serial and also location 	which we can scan in off a barcode
- update the scsan update to allow for updating all the serials within a location instead of just a device one by one, if 	I have a bunch of devices in a location then I can update all at once when I scan the location barcode.
- dropdown for themes
- the row colors for device status tracking should be dynamic with theme as well, they should switch with the theme.
-on scan update location disapperas when you scan one, i dont want it to dissaper because sometimes I may scan multiplle 		things back to back
- fix visual bug on device status tracking, per page: and the drop down are on seperate lines
- update categories across whole app so it's consistent
- when bulk on, in ipad provisioning, add a way or a button or something to say this is a Tmobile ipad, and a way to 	change the sim card number and then update it in the database. Also, instead of the button being Update Serial 	for.
	Selected it should be Update Sim fort selected.
	WHen it's a tmobile ipad the carrier should say Tmobile and the Carrier account number changes to TMB-x285
- Change labeling in gui from Disposal location to BoxID
- update the SIM on the last ipad sent 3003
- Auto dispose EOL devices on intake
	- upadate the mel rules table using the excel doc upload. It has these headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	RedeployOOWThreshold	Specification. We can use the Model column from the xlsx doc to match it to what we have in the model_number column of the db.
	- add a way to upload the mel rules document to update the table
	- add template information to recreate if needed and error checking for document format
	- The templte document has these column headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	Redeploy   Threshold	Specification
-update migrate scripts for new categories.
- update package details window and error windwos. Double check that all windows and popups to have same title menu bar styles as rest of app
- update GUI to only use orgiialnl dispoed substatueses and get rid of e-waste
- logic for handling same tracking number?
-update script to use new categories
- update autofill information, I don't see things that are considired disposal coming up on the autofill
- Update all items Disposal/EOL to new status
- sanitize (retunr)(reutnr)
- import skus again just in case 
- add check when bulk ipad provsion on, if Country is PR change to tmobile automatically then mark which on is set to that on the gui
- update devcie status tracdking window to include box id requirement for disposal when I click on a serial
- add double click funtionality to package management to open selected package
- How to be more granular on dashboard.
- awaiting disposal is showing 0
- add a way to store dynamically the device goals so it saves if we update that goal instead of hardcoding it.
- when I hover over awaiting disposal I want it to tell me what types of devices / statues are included in that number. Same for Avtive Triage/Repair.
-find a way to fix the flag requires review status, I think i've already intook and processed a bunch of these devices so i want to dou8ble check that only the ones that have that status are the right ones.I want to compare the intake date of the device as also use the probable cause report that I use to import flags, it includes the Opened columed which is the date the ticket was opened and then probalbe causde and serial numerb, the ticket gets made first and then the user ships it back so we receive it after the ticket is made. Lets use that data to decipher what I've received already or not and then set the status apprpriately, I want to recusievely go through and have it ask me if I want to update it based and give me all the info about it so I can make the decision. I want to also consider the staus the device currently has as well.
- How does the device autofill data table work, the everon serial column is only for eveeron devies right to display that device is a everon serial when we intake, how does that work with is_everon in the deispotion info table. how does the dispotion info 
- Sanitize device autofill data fromj device autofill_data table
- on generic barcode do the last 14 and last 20 options radio buttons
- Set to disposal can-am pending.
