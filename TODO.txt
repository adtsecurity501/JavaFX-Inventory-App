Priority 1:
- Auto dispose EOL devices on intake
	- upadate the mel rules table using the excel doc upload. It has these headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	RedeployOOWThreshold	Specification. We can use the Model column from the xlsx doc to match it to what we have in the model_number column of the db.
	- add a way to upload the mel rules document to update the table
	- add template information to recreate if needed and error checking for document format
	- The templte document has these column headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	Redeploy   Threshold	Specification
- clean the monitor data, look for long dell serials that are incorrect. 
- Dig into WIP backlog, what is that?
- update statuses and substatuses across whole app so it's consistent
- update categories and statuses in database
- autogenerate box id, change labeling in gui from Disposal location to BoxID

Priority 2:
- How to be more granular on dashboard.
- fix visual bug on label printing tab, when you click generic barcode the whole row increases in size
- test printing labels from scan update.
- Test all features extensively
- Make sure history works
- add monitors back to WIP on dash
- 


At End:
- import skus again just in case 
- clean up code and extra files
- create executable for program 


DONE:
- Same row height for all in the package management tab
- double check view for same serial multiple times
- double check that the import flags doens't afecct the dispostion of devices that are actually good to go.
- Logic for If flag date is from before, and we then process and intake a device, then set the status to ready for deployment.
- Clean up all Categorys
- Update serial intake to ignore SERIAL NUMBER	IMEI/MEID	ICCID	Capacity	Name rows
- Change the flow of UI for ipad bulk
- Add receive date to view history and remove receipt ID column from the Devcice history window.
- add a way to search throught the ipads in the db in the ipad provisioning, maybe some filters?
- add button to update the serial for selected row of ipad on staged devices for export
- Add search and filters to sku management
- integrate items.xlsx into the sku table
- add flow to accomodate for monitor intake
	-what I do is first input/Scan serial
	-then I add description of what it is using autofill hopefully if it's there, if not I manually add info
	- I then test the monitor to see if it's functinoing and not broken, then I want to have option for ready to 		deploy so that it sets the correcct status and print the labels for it using the sku table and 		description I put in.
	- if not functinoing then dispositoin option as disposal canam
- update SKU_table_import script so that it properly attaches sku to description based on options
- Integrate the label printing code
	-checkbox print toggle on scan update so I dont have to have user interaction
	-add autocomplete
	-move bulk section together maybe rething the layout and grouping
- update the scan update logic for disposal, if we want to dispose of something you have to have serial and also location 	which we can scan in off a barcode
- update the scsan update to allow for updating all the serials within a location instead of just a device one by one, if 	I have a bunch of devices in a location then I can update all at once when I scan the location barcode.
- dropdown for themes
- the row colors for device status tracking should be dynamic with theme as well, they should switch with the theme.
-on scan update location disapperas when you scan one, i dont want it to dissaper because sometimes I may scan multiplle 		things back to back
- fix visual bug on device status tracking, per page: and the drop down are on seperate lines
- update categories across whole app so it's consistent
