Priority 1:
- clean the monitor data, look for long dell serials that are incorrect. 
- Dig into WIP backlog, what is that?
- update statuses and substatuses across whole app so it's consistent
- update categories and statuses in database

Priority 2:
- How to be more granular on dashboard.
- fix visual bug on label printing tab, when you click generic barcode the whole row increases in size
- test printing labels from scan update.
- Test all features extensively
- Make sure history works
- add monitors back to WIP on dash
-


At End:
- import skus again just in case 
- clean up code and extra files
- create executable for program 


DONE:
- Same row height for all in the package management tab
- double check view for same serial multiple times
- double check that the import flags doens't afecct the dispostion of devices that are actually good to go.
- Logic for If flag date is from before, and we then process and intake a device, then set the status to ready for deployment.
- Clean up all Categorys
- Update serial intake to ignore SERIAL NUMBER	IMEI/MEID	ICCID	Capacity	Name rows
- Change the flow of UI for ipad bulk
- Add receive date to view history and remove receipt ID column from the Devcice history window.
- add a way to search throught the ipads in the db in the ipad provisioning, maybe some filters?
- add button to update the serial for selected row of ipad on staged devices for export
- Add search and filters to sku management
- integrate items.xlsx into the sku table
- add flow to accomodate for monitor intake
	-what I do is first input/Scan serial
	-then I add description of what it is using autofill hopefully if it's there, if not I manually add info
	- I then test the monitor to see if it's functinoing and not broken, then I want to have option for ready to 		deploy so that it sets the correcct status and print the labels for it using the sku table and 		description I put in.
	- if not functinoing then dispositoin option as disposal canam
- update SKU_table_import script so that it properly attaches sku to description based on options
- Integrate the label printing code
	-checkbox print toggle on scan update so I dont have to have user interaction
	-add autocomplete
	-move bulk section together maybe rething the layout and grouping
- update the scan update logic for disposal, if we want to dispose of something you have to have serial and also location 	which we can scan in off a barcode
- update the scsan update to allow for updating all the serials within a location instead of just a device one by one, if 	I have a bunch of devices in a location then I can update all at once when I scan the location barcode.
- dropdown for themes
- the row colors for device status tracking should be dynamic with theme as well, they should switch with the theme.
-on scan update location disapperas when you scan one, i dont want it to dissaper because sometimes I may scan multiplle 		things back to back
- fix visual bug on device status tracking, per page: and the drop down are on seperate lines
- update categories across whole app so it's consistent
- when bulk on, in ipad provisioning, add a way or a button or something to say this is a Tmobile ipad, and a way to 	change the sim card number and then update it in the database. Also, instead of the button being Update Serial 	for.
	Selected it should be Update Sim fort selected.
	WHen it's a tmobile ipad the carrier should say Tmobile and the Carrier account number changes to TMB-x285
- Change labeling in gui from Disposal location to BoxID
- update the SIM on the last ipad sent 3003
- Auto dispose EOL devices on intake
	- upadate the mel rules table using the excel doc upload. It has these headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	RedeployOOWThreshold	Specification. We can use the Model column from the xlsx doc to match it to what we have in the model_number column of the db.
	- add a way to upload the mel rules document to update the table
	- add template information to recreate if needed and error checking for document format
	- The templte document has these column headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	Redeploy   Threshold	Specification
