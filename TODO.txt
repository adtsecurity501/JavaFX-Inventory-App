Priority 1:
- add way to import information into the device_autofill_data table .
- When I minimize the window it goes to the bottom left corner and it has no styles
- The code needs to change for ipadsettings I think Im calling the wrong table name or something when seraahing serial in the ipad provisioning table for postgres version.




Priority 2:

- test printing labels from scan update.
- Test all features extensively
- Make sure history works
- clean the monitor data, look for long dell serials that are incorrect. 
- update statuses and substatuses across whole app so it's consistent
- Dig into WIP backlog, what is that?
- inlclude monitors in the WIP backlog on dashboard


At End:
- clean up code and extra files and tables
- add comments and describe the code so that a dev can work on it and update, maybe make a manual for it.
- create executable for program 
- Update the readme


DONE:
- Same row height for all in the package management tab
- double check view for same serial multiple times
- double check that the import flags doens't afecct the dispostion of devices that are actually good to go.
- Logic for If flag date is from before, and we then process and intake a device, then set the status to ready for deployment.
- Clean up all Categorys
- Update serial intake to ignore SERIAL NUMBER	IMEI/MEID	ICCID	Capacity	Name rows
- Change the flow of UI for ipad bulk
- Add receive date to view history and remove receipt ID column from the Devcice history window.
- add a way to search throught the ipads in the db in the ipad provisioning, maybe some filters?
- add button to update the serial for selected row of ipad on staged devices for export
- Add search and filters to sku management
- integrate items.xlsx into the sku table
- add flow to accomodate for monitor intake
	-what I do is first input/Scan serial
	-then I add description of what it is using autofill hopefully if it's there, if not I manually add info
	- I then test the monitor to see if it's functinoing and not broken, then I want to have option for ready to 		deploy so that it sets the correcct status and print the labels for it using the sku table and 		description I put in.
	- if not functinoing then dispositoin option as disposal canam
- update SKU_table_import script so that it properly attaches sku to description based on options
- Integrate the label printing code
	-checkbox print toggle on scan update so I dont have to have user interaction
	-add autocomplete
	-move bulk section together maybe rething the layout and grouping
- update the scan update logic for disposal, if we want to dispose of something you have to have serial and also location 	which we can scan in off a barcode
- update the scsan update to allow for updating all the serials within a location instead of just a device one by one, if 	I have a bunch of devices in a location then I can update all at once when I scan the location barcode.
- dropdown for themes
- the row colors for device status tracking should be dynamic with theme as well, they should switch with the theme.
-on scan update location disapperas when you scan one, i dont want it to dissaper because sometimes I may scan multiplle 		things back to back
- fix visual bug on device status tracking, per page: and the drop down are on seperate lines
- update categories across whole app so it's consistent
- when bulk on, in ipad provisioning, add a way or a button or something to say this is a Tmobile ipad, and a way to 	change the sim card number and then update it in the database. Also, instead of the button being Update Serial 	for.
	Selected it should be Update Sim fort selected.
	WHen it's a tmobile ipad the carrier should say Tmobile and the Carrier account number changes to TMB-x285
- Change labeling in gui from Disposal location to BoxID
- update the SIM on the last ipad sent 3003
- Auto dispose EOL devices on intake
	- upadate the mel rules table using the excel doc upload. It has these headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	RedeployOOWThreshold	Specification. We can use the Model column from the xlsx doc to match it to what we have in the model_number column of the db.
	- add a way to upload the mel rules document to update the table
	- add template information to recreate if needed and error checking for document format
	- The templte document has these column headers: Model	Description	Action	SPECIAL NOTES	Device	Mfg	Redeploy   Threshold	Specification
-update migrate scripts for new categories.
- update package details window and error windwos. Double check that all windows and popups to have same title menu bar styles as rest of app
- update GUI to only use orgiialnl dispoed substatueses and get rid of e-waste
- logic for handling same tracking number?
-update script to use new categories
- update autofill information, I don't see things that are considired disposal coming up on the autofill
- Update all items Disposal/EOL to new status
- sanitize (retunr)(reutnr)
- import skus again just in case 
- add check when bulk ipad provsion on, if Country is PR change to tmobile automatically then mark which on is set to that on the gui
- update devcie status tracdking window to include box id requirement for disposal when I click on a serial
- add double click funtionality to package management to open selected package
- How to be more granular on dashboard.
- awaiting disposal is showing 0
- add a way to store dynamically the device goals so it saves if we update that goal instead of hardcoding it.
- when I hover over awaiting disposal I want it to tell me what types of devices / statues are included in that number. Same for Avtive Triage/Repair.
-find a way to fix the flag requires review status, I think i've already intook and processed a bunch of these devices so i want to dou8ble check that only the ones that have that status are the right ones.I want to compare the intake date of the device as also use the probable cause report that I use to import flags, it includes the Opened columed which is the date the ticket was opened and then probalbe causde and serial numerb, the ticket gets made first and then the user ships it back so we receive it after the ticket is made. Lets use that data to decipher what I've received already or not and then set the status apprpriately, I want to recusievely go through and have it ask me if I want to update it based and give me all the info about it so I can make the decision. I want to also consider the staus the device currently has as well.
- How does the device autofill data table work, the everon serial column is only for eveeron devies right to display that device is a everon serial when we intake, how does that work with is_everon in the deispotion info table. how does the dispotion info 
- Sanitize device autofill data fromj device autofill_data table
- on generic barcode do the last 14 and last 20 options radio buttons
- Set to disposal can-am pending.

- Visual bug where not all the lines of the same status are colored on device status tracking
- Add in a way to view BOXID information, count , devices, etc.../.
- verify where boxid is being stored
- Add a way to add all the faiuiled / uncrecognized scans to a package and add a new flow for how to add a descriptioion and stuff to each one.
- autofill for sku on monitor intake is not wortking 
- Visual bug for when dispossing fromm monitor intake, when I click Broken / Dispose  on the window that appears the Confirm Disposal textxs is there but there is no button , the button for confirm disposal is missing. 
- when I update the status on the device status stracking page It shoiuld auto refresh when I cluck the update button, I want to make the application quick and efficient across the board, what can I do to increase speeds and reduce the amount of calls that it makes to the DB
- when I click on an autofill suggestion it works correctly it autofills the information but then I have to click each field because the new info causes the fields to display the autofill info again.
- I want to intake a pcakage and make sure that everything is being created correctly on the back end.
Tracking is: 10000276112155
serial is:D5MQKQ3
device is a:Optiplex 3000 
- add error checking in serials for symbols and spaces and period and stuff
- fix the way the program handles priting the labels on scan updates ready to deploy. Currently when I scan a serail it prints out the labesls but the text shoes Descreiiption not found.
- increase width of the autocomplete suggestions drop down, current it is too narrow
- add tools to box id viewere tab
- when an error appears or a window apperas sometimes it dissapears minimized super small to the left bottom corner 
- no hover effect for - or square in the title menu bar also make sure all windows and errors have the styled title menu bar.
- fix visual bug on label printing tab, when you click generic barcode the whole row increases in size
- when I open a package for example, the minimize button in the title menu bar is selected and it has a border around it that shows that Its selected, I dont want it to be selected by default. 
- update the flow for when you are doing scan update and then you have failed packages and you click the process failed scans, instead of making a tracking number FAILED_SCANS_[date...], I want to be able to choose which pacakage to add them too or if i want have the option to create a new package.
- I need to update the scan update so that the sku stays after you scan a serial becasue sometimes I scan and deploy multiple of the same sku at once and scan all of them.
- add autofill dropdowns for sku managemnt, I got a error sku number cannot be emptyThat is wrong becasue I might add autofill information likke Descriptopn categoryt model and manufac to the sku table
- When i click on the autocomplete suggestion it adds it to the field but then the suggestion pops up again and I have to click it again to fill it in
- I need a way to edit a device once it's been added in case I forget to set the right cateogry or description or something, and then maybe even a way to safe delete a device or package if it was my by accident. It will then ask you to type DELETE to delete it.
- on the process failed scsans for package lost window I need the cateogyrt make model description fields to have autofill and a way to search the serial umber to see if it has autofill information that also does the same thing if I double clcick on serial field and press enter.
- the autofill in prodcess failed scans for package lost isn't correctly giving me the suggestinos. 
- I have a box id at the top of the list that is blank and says there are 2 devices in side but when I click on it it shows alot more than 2, what is going on?
- on scan update the sizing is off between succesful scans and failed/unrefnized scans windwos. The sucess. scans windows is smaller and i think it's because it doesn't have the process failed scans button
- update DB
- rename the database and change paths everwhere
-I need to rework how I import devices to the h2 db. For some reason when I click the import device files button on the dashboard the logic isnt working correctly. I want to sit down and completely rething it using best practices and iimprovements. what can you suggest? Currently Im dealing with duplicate sims (ICCIDs) and also duplicate IMEIs across multiple devices.
- since i updated the template for printing labels I need it to automatically go in and edlete the old template on the computer instead of me manually having to go into C:\Users\lcorsini\ADT_Label_Templates and doing it, but it needs to be dynamic and do it on whatever computer / user
- Lets update the Boxes assempbled (insert dynamic rnage here) and lables created (insert dynamic rnage here) titles to be dynamic depednign on the time range radio button I select.
- I have old cateogieys showing up in the device status traking fileter optuins dropdown when 	I click on hem no devices pop up.
- Make the serach on scan update sku Search for sku to print less specific so I can find devices using upper or lower case and in different order so I can find a 9TH GEN IPAD searching with ipad 9th gen for example H2 db.
-Auto search serial numbers and try to populate fields when I click the process failed scans on scan upadte window as If I were to click on the serial filed and press enter.
-update the scan updates processed ready to deploy descriptuion that prints on the lablels when I select a sku to print the description from the SKU not the descriptiuon from the device
- update the scan update serach to let me also searcj for the sku itself
