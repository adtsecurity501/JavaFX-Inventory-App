Priority 1:
- Auto dispose EOL on intake
- update the scan update logic for disposal, if we want to dispose of something you have to have serial and also location 	which we can scan in off a barcode
- clean the monitor data, look for long dell serials that are incorrect. 
- update python script to accomodate for new tables bulk_devices and device_assignments

Priority 2:
- How to be more granular on dashboard.
- Dig into WIP backlog, what is that?
- Bulk update status option
- fix visual bug on label printing tab, when you click generic barcode the whole row increases in size
- test printing labels from scan update

At End:
-dropdown for themes
- import skus again just in case 
-clean up code and extra files
-create executable for program 
-fix window title bar to look the same on all windows with the icons including error windows

DONE:
- Same row height for all in the package management tab
- double check view for same serial multiple times
- double check that the import flags doens't afecct the dispostion of devices that are actually good to go.
- Logic for If flag date is from before, and we then process and intake a device, then set the status to ready for deployment.
- Clean up all Categorys
- Update serial intake to ignore SERIAL NUMBER	IMEI/MEID	ICCID	Capacity	Name rows
- Change the flow of UI for ipad bulk
- Add receive date to view history and remove receipt ID column from the Devcice history window.
- add a way to search throught the ipads in the db in the ipad provisioning, maybe some filters?
- add button to update the serial for selected row of ipad on staged devices for export
- Add search and filters to sku management
- integrate items.xlsx into the sku table
- add flow to accomodate for monitor intake
	-what I do is first input/Scan serial
	-then I add description of what it is using autofill hopefully if it's there, if not I manually add info
	- I then test the monitor to see if it's functinoing and not broken, then I want to have option for ready to 		deploy so that it sets the correcct status and print the labels for it using the sku table and 		description I put in.
	- if not functinoing then dispositoin option as disposal canam
- update SKU_table_import script so that it properly attaches sku to description based on options
- Integrate the label printing code
	-checkbox print toggle on scan update so I dont have to have user interaction
	-add autocomplete
	-move bulk section together maybe rething the layout and grouping
